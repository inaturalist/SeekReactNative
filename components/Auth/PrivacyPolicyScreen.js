  Your Consent
</h3>

<p>
  You should read this entire Privacy Policy before submitting information to Us or using Our Platform. Whenever You submit personal and non-personal information via Our Platform or otherwise to Us, whether online or offline, You consent to the collection, use disclosure, transfer, and storage of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="types" href="#types" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-link"></i></a>
  Types of Information We Collect
</h3>

<p>
  "Personal Information" means information such as Your first/middle initial or name, last name, e-mail address, street address, mailing address if different, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, profile photograph, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, credit card information and any other information that could allow someone to identify You or contact You, including information collected through cookies and other technology.
</p>

<p>
  iNaturalist collects Personal Information of the sort that web browsers, hardware, software and servers typically make available, such as the IP address, device ID, browser type, language preference, referring site, pages viewed, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, and the date and time of each visitor request. iNaturalist's purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how iNaturalist's visitors use its Platform. From time to time, iNaturalist may release such information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Platform.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="collect" href="#collect" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-link"></i></a>
  How We Collect Personal Information
</h3>

<p>
  iNaturalist may collect Personal Information when You choose to interact with iNaturalist in ways that require iNaturalist to gather such information, such as if You browse on iNaturalist, register as an iNaturalist User, update or add information to Your iNaturalist profile, provide content to iNaturalist through Your computer or phone, make a donation to iNaturalist through the Platform, make a purchase from the iNaturalist Store (collectively, the iNaturalist "Services"), or otherwise communicate or engage with Us about the iNaturalist Services. When You record an encounter with an individual organism at a particular time and location and post it on iNaturalist (an “Observation”), We may collect Your User ID, latitude and longitude of the site of the Observation, the place name of the site of the Observation, the date and time of the Observation, the metadata associated with image or sound files, the app You used to contribute data, and the time zone of the site of the Observation. The amount and type of information that iNaturalist gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, iNaturalist collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of Your interaction with iNaturalist. iNaturalist does not disclose Personal Information other than as described herein. You can refuse to supply Personal Information, with the caveat that doing so may prevent You from engaging in certain Website and App-related activities, such as registering as an iNaturalist User, maintaining an iNaturalist profile, posting content to iNaturalist, making a donation, or purchasing an item from the iNaturalist Store. Without providing personal information (other than the automatic provision of Your IP address), You will still be able to access and use iNaturalist on a read-only basis.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="use" href="#use" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-link"></i></a>
  How We Use Personal Information
</h3>

<p>
  We may use the Personal Information that You provide in order to deliver the iNaturalist Services and to administer and maintain the iNaturalist Websites, respond to Your inquiries, improve our services, business, and Platform, manage our business including spam detection and fraud prevention purposes, for marketing, legal and research purposes, and to understand how You use Our Platform and Services. If You register as an iNaturalist User, You must give Us current, complete and accurate information and keep the information You provide to Us up to date. We cannot and shall not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if You do not give Us current, accurate, truthful, or complete information or if You fail to update the information You give Us.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="disclose" href="#disclose" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-link"></i></a>
  When We Disclose and Share Personal Information
</h3>

<p>
  Personal Information You provide related to the Observations You post (user name, date, time, location) is published in venues on iNaturalist where it is visible to anyone ("Published") as matter of normal usage and therefore is publicly shared with other iNaturalist Users, whether or not they are signed in. We also explicitly and publicly share this information in a machine-readable format with a handful of partners, including the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ("<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>"), the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/open-data-sponsorship-program/">Amazon Web Services ("AWS") Open Data Sponsorship Program</a>, and others.
</p>

<p>
  We share Personal Information associated with Users’ registration and account (non-public location data from Observations You post, IP address, email address, etc.) with representatives from iNaturalist Network Members (see <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/network">https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/network</a> for information about the iNaturalist Network) only for Users who have chosen to affiliate with that specific Network Member as their primary site. iNaturalist Network Members are responsible for the secure storage and responsible use of the data, and develop their own criteria on how data may or may not be reshared for non-commercial research, conservation, and species management purposes. You can prevent this sharing by affiliating with iNaturalist.org in your account settings.
</p>

<p>
  Unless you have specifically chosen to hide it, iNaturalist, in its sole discretion, may disclose non-public location data of threatened or sensitive species to researchers and affiliated organizations for research, conservation, and species management purposes.
</p>

<p>
  iNaturalist discloses Personal Information to contractors, service providers, consultants and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on iNaturalist's behalf or to provide Services available at iNaturalist's Platform, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
</p>

<p>
  Some of iNaturalist’s contractors, service providers and affiliated organizations may be located outside of Your home country; by using iNaturalist's Platform, You consent to the transfer of such information to them. iNaturalist will not rent or sell Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal information with entities that support Our Websites and data, communicating with You, fraud and spam detection, data analytics, and other legitimate business purposes including communicating with the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, Google Analytics, Google Firebase and New Relic.
</p>

<p>
  We use Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, Google Maps Platform (to display geographic content), and SendGrid. If You choose to participate in some optional services, We will share Personal Information with entities that make those services possible, such as Civilized Discourse Construction Kit (for the iNaturalist Forum); Donorbox and Stripe (for charitable donations); and Threadless (for the iNaturalist Store). You can withdraw from participation in these services by contacting Us at <a href="mailto:privacy@inaturalist.org">privacy@inaturalist.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Other than as described above, iNaturalist discloses Personal Information only when required to do so by law, or when iNaturalist believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of iNaturalist, third parties, or the public at large. Unless authorized by You through Your opt-in, or as provided above, We will make Your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties only in the following circumstances:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If We are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court, or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process);
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If We believe Your actions violate a law, regulation, this Privacy Policy, or any applicable website or app's terms of use, or if You threaten the rights, property or safety of Us, Our Websites, Our Apps, any other Users, or third party;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If, in Our sole discretion, We believe disclosure is necessary to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect Our assets, to defend Our interests or comply with Our legal and regulatory obligations; or to protect a User's safety;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there is a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving iNaturalist, the Academy or National Geographic.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If You are a registered User of iNaturalist and have supplied Your email address, iNaturalist may occasionally send You an email to tell You about new features, solicit Your feedback, or just keep You up to date with what's going on with iNaturalist and Our services. We primarily use blogs and groups to communicate this type of information, so We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If You send Us a request (for example via a support email or via one of Our feedback mechanisms), We reserve the right to publish it in order to help Us clarify or respond to Your request or to help Us support other Users. iNaturalist takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of Personal Information. You can unsubscribe from email communications by changing your account settings, deleting your account, or contacting Us at <a href="mailto:privacy@inaturalist.org">privacy@inaturalist.org</a>.

  Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
</h3>

<p>
  If You are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), or otherwise subject to the GDPR, iNaturalist's legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information We collect and the specific context in which We collect it. In addition, We process Personal Information with the principle of data minimization in mind. This means that We limit ourselves to the minimum amount of personal information which is needed to achieve the particular purpose for which We process the Personal Information. Below are some examples of the purposes for which Personal Information may be processed.
</p>

<p>
  iNaturalist may process Your Personal Information because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The processing is necessary to provide the services and features You have requested
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The processing is necessary to perform a contract with You
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of Our business, such as fraud prevention, information security, or to comply with the law
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You have provided consent for Us to do so.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <strong>The Seek App</strong> collects very little user data as it does not require an account of any kind and all records are, by default, stored only on the user's mobile device. 
</p>

<p>
  An <strong>optional</strong> feature of Seek is to create an iNaturalist account and selectively submit geolocated photos and observations to iNaturalist. <strong>If You use this optional feature of Seek to post observations to iNaturalist, You will be subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service of iNaturalist, located at <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy">https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy</a> and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/terms">https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/terms</a>.</strong> Please read these policies before posting an observation.
</p>

<p>
  For the Seek App ("Seek" or the "App") , iNaturalist ("iNaturalist," "We," "Us" or "Our") does not seek or collect Personal Information (as defined below) from users ("You," "or "User") other than IP addresses, as discussed below.
</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>
  The Seek App takes many special precautions to protect User privacy to ensure safe use by persons 12 years of age or younger. The App does not require a user account or other log in:  latitude and longitude coordinates transmitted by the App to identify species near the User are rounded to two decimal places before transmission in order to protect the precise location of the User; Images are stored on the device, are only transmitted for the sole purpose of identifying the species photographed, and are deleted from servers shortly after processing by the identification algorithm.
</p>

<p>
  Badges awarded within the App are stored solely within the App on the User’s device. No information about other Users of the App is made publicly available, except in aggregate form to report on usage patterns and trends for the App.
</p>

<p>
  Seek Users 12 years of age or younger who try to create an iNaturalist account to publicly share data outside of Seek by posting to iNaturalist are required to get parental consent via this link: <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/user_parents/new">http://www.inaturalist.org/user_parents/new</a>.
</p>

<h3>App Users</h3>

<p>
  iNaturalist collects non-personal information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. iNaturalist's purpose in collecting non-personal information is to better understand how iNaturalist's visitors use its Website and Apps. From time to time, iNaturalist may release non-personal information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website and Apps.
</p>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>
  Seek by iNaturalist does NOT request or collect Personal Information  that would allow someone to identify You or contact You. When Seek connects to iNaturalist servers over the Internet, iNaturalist automatically collects IP addresses. It uses IP addresses solely for the purposes of communication between You and the iNaturalist servers and does not disclose such information, other than under the limited circumstances described below. Server logs including IP addresses persist for no more than 60 days. Images submitted by Seek for the purpose of automatic identification may include location data embedded in the image files themselves. Such location data, along with the image submitted, are generally deleted within 1 hour of being received. Rounded location data separate from the image may persist in server logs for up to 60 days.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>
  The App does not use cookies.
</p>

<h3>Links and Third Parties</h3>

<p>
  The App does not contain external links, other than to iNaturalist. There are no third parties involved except for requests logged on iNaturalist to view species pages. Any such requests to iNaturalist do not contain any personal information other than the User's IP address.
</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

<p>
  Although most changes are likely to be minor, iNaturalist may change the Seek Privacy Policy from time to time, and in iNaturalist's sole discretion. We will post an updated and revised version of this Privacy Policy on the iNaturalist Website and within the Seek App when any material changes have been made. Users of the App are encouraged to check this Privacy Policy often so You are aware of the most current terms and conditions that apply to You. Your continued use of the App after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute Your acceptance of such change.
