    "june_description": "Every species in a coral reef is important to the rest of the wildlife community, whether it is food for other creatures or a predator that keeps other populations under control. Food chains can be delicate and complex, and this is the case in every ecosystem on our planet. Seek out different levels in your local web of life, and learn how each one enables other species to survive.",
    "november_description": "Humans have always depended on trees and forests for survival. They give us clean air, food, shelter and wood. They take in carbon from the air and lock it away in their wood or the soil. Spending time among trees makes us feel better in mind and body. We need them now even more than ever, and so do a huge number of other living things. Seek out the trees in your local area and feel the benefits for yourself!",
    "august_description": "Big animals of the grassland plains are losing their habitat to farmland, but they are not the only wildlife affected by our food production. Insects populations are declining around our planet, partly because crops replace their habitats and are then sprayed with bug-killing pesticides. We need insect pollinators for our crops and wild plants to flourish, and many amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals depend on insects for food. Seek out the insects around you and show them some love!",
    "september_description": "Freshwater is essential for all life on land, and freshwater habitats are home to more than 10 per cent of all known animals and almost half of all known fish species. Rivers, streams and lakes allow wildlife to travel vast distances to complete their life cycles. Seek out ponds, streams, rivers and lakes in your area and see what freshwater species you can spot.",
    "october_description": "The seas cover vast areas of our planet, and without modern technology humans would find it very difficult to cross these huge expanses. Many bird species, however, do exactly this every year. Millions of birds migrate from one country to another to escape cold weather and to find food. Keeping track of when wildlife migrates can help us understand how climate change is affecting the natural world. Seek birds visiting your local area and find out where else they spend their time.",
    "december_description": "Climate change is not just affecting the frozen worlds at our planet’s poles. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can cause species to move out of habitats that become uncomfortable and into areas that couldn’t support them before. It can also mean that changes linked to seasons (known as ‘phenology’) such as leaf fall, bud burst and flowering start to take place at different times. This may cause problems for other species that are hard to predict. Seek out your local plant life and see how your local environment may be changing.",

This year's theme for Earth Day (April 22nd) is \"Restore our Earth.\" We all need to work together to build a more sustainable future for both communities and wildlife—your individual actions can help to make a difference!",
    "apr_2021_action": "One of the most widespread human impacts on ecosystems is trash. As you explore nature this month, pay attention to the litter you see and think about where it may have come from.

Some species—such as lichens, moss and odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) are known to be indicators of ecological health. When you see these species it's a good sign that your ecosystem is healthy!",
    "may_2021_action": "Healthy ecosystems have important benefits on our own health and well-being. Time spent in nature can help people recover from stress, improve their mood and think more clearly. Find a peaceful spot in nature and spend an hour focusing on the sights, sounds, smells, and textures around you. Write down some of your observations. How does this time spent in nature make you feel? Share a photo of your spot using #NatGeoSeekChallenge on Twitter!",

For example, we can help take care of a particular place like our own yard, a protected area, or a local park. Protecting nature starts by learning about the plants, fungi and animals that are in the places that you care about. Your challenge this month is to look in your yard or a local park and take an inventory of as much biodiversity as you can.",
    "june_2021_action": "This month, focus on learning something about each species you document, including which ones are native and which are introduced.  Reflect on all of your observations over the past four months— what differences have you noticed in biodiversity and the human footprint across this period and across the different places you've explored? Identify something you can commit to doing to help make a local place (such as your yard or a park) healthier for native species. Write down your goal, take a photo of it, and share it with us at #NatGeoSeekChallenge on Twitter!",
