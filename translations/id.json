    "action_september": "Keep a record of how much water you use throughout a day. Think how you could cut this down to help reduce the strain on freshwater habitats.\n\nCheck local freshwater habitats for litter or other pollution. Could you run a local campaign to protect this precious ecosystem?",
    "action_october": "Birds need fuel for the long journeys they take to migrate. In winter months leave nuts, seeds and fat balls in your garden to give them a boost.\n\nPlant trees and shrubs that provide berries and roosts for visiting birds.",
    "action_december": "Seek out or start a citizen science project that monitors changing patterns in your local phenology. This data can help scientists understand the impact of climate change and predict what problems this might cause.",
    "june_description": "Every species in a coral reef is important to the rest of the wildlife community, whether it is food for other creatures or a predator that keeps other populations under control. Food chains can be delicate and complex, and this is the case in every ecosystem on our planet. Seek out different levels in your local web of life, and learn how each one enables other species to survive.",
    "november_description": "Humans have always depended on trees and forests for survival. They give us clean air, food, shelter and wood. They take in carbon from the air and lock it away in their wood or the soil. Spending time among trees makes us feel better in mind and body. We need them now even more than ever, and so do a huge number of other living things. Seek out the trees in your local area and feel the benefits for yourself!",
    "august_description": "Big animals of the grassland plains are losing their habitat to farmland, but they are not the only wildlife affected by our food production. Insects populations are declining around our planet, partly because crops replace their habitats and are then sprayed with bug-killing pesticides. We need insect pollinators for our crops and wild plants to flourish, and many amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals depend on insects for food. Seek out the insects around you and show them some love!",
    "september_description": "Freshwater is essential for all life on land, and freshwater habitats are home to more than 10 per cent of all known animals and almost half of all known fish species. Rivers, streams and lakes allow wildlife to travel vast distances to complete their life cycles. Seek out ponds, streams, rivers and lakes in your area and see what freshwater species you can spot.",
    "october_description": "The seas cover vast areas of our planet, and without modern technology humans would find it very difficult to cross these huge expanses. Many bird species, however, do exactly this every year. Millions of birds migrate from one country to another to escape cold weather and to find food. Keeping track of when wildlife migrates can help us understand how climate change is affecting the natural world. Seek birds visiting your local area and find out where else they spend their time.",
    "december_description": "Climate change is not just affecting the frozen worlds at our planet’s poles. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can cause species to move out of habitats that become uncomfortable and into areas that couldn’t support them before. It can also mean that changes linked to seasons (known as ‘phenology’) such as leaf fall, bud burst and flowering start to take place at different times. This may cause problems for other species that are hard to predict. Seek out your local plant life and see how your local environment may be changing.",

If possible, we encourage you to pick a place such as a local park, protected area, or your yard that you visit every month as part of your explorations with Seek. For this month's mission: find any ten species that make you feel happy!\n\nTo find resources to help you use Seek and learn more about biodiversity, visit NatGeoEd.org/BioBlitz.",

For example, we can help take care of a particular place like our own yard, a protected area, or a local park. Protecting nature starts by learning about the plants, fungi and animals that are in the places that you care about. Your challenge this month is to look in your yard or a local park and take an inventory of as much biodiversity as you can.",
    "june_2021_action": "This month, focus on learning something about each species you document, including which ones are native and which are introduced.  Reflect on all of your observations over the past four months— what differences have you noticed in biodiversity and the human footprint across this period and across the different places you've explored? Identify something you can commit to doing to help make a local place (such as your yard or a park) healthier for native species. Write down your goal, take a photo of it, and share it with us at #NatGeoSeekChallenge on Twitter!",
