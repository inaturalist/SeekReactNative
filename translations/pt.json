Food chains can be delicate and complex, and this is the case in every ecosystem on our planet. Seek out different levels in your local web of life, and learn how each one enables other species to survive.",
    "november_description": "Humans have always depended on trees and forests for survival. They give us clean air, food, shelter and wood. They take in carbon from the air and lock it away in their wood or the soil. Spending time among trees makes us feel better in mind and body. We need them now even more than ever, and so do a huge number of other living things. Seek out the trees in your local area and feel the benefits for yourself!",
    "august_description": "Os grandes animais das planícies de pastagem estão a perder o seu habitat para os terrenos agrícolas, mas não são a única forma de vida selvagem afetada pela nossa produção de alimentos. As populações de insetos estão a diminuir no nosso planeta, em parte porque as colheitas substituem os seus habitats e são pulverizadas com pesticidas para matar insetos. Precisamos de insetos polinizadores para as nossas culturas e plantas selvagens floresceres, e muitos anfíbios, répteis, aves e mamíferos dependem de insetos para se alimentarem. Procure os insetos à sua volta e dedique-lhes algum amor!",
    "september_description": "A água doce é essencial para toda a vida na terra, e os habitats de água doce servem de casa a mais de 10% de todos os animais conhecidos e quase metade de todas as espécies de peixes conhecidas. Rios, riachos e lagos permitem que a vida selvagem percorra grandes distâncias para completar seus ciclos de vida. Procure lagoas, riachos, rios e lagos na sua área e veja que espécies de água doce consegue localizar.",
    "october_description": "The seas cover vast areas of our planet, and without modern technology humans would find it very difficult to cross these huge expanses. Many bird species, however, do exactly this every year. Millions of birds migrate from one country to another to escape cold weather and to find food. Keeping track of when wildlife migrates can help us understand how climate change is affecting the natural world. Seek birds visiting your local area and find out where else they spend their time.",
    "december_description": "Climate change is not just affecting the frozen worlds at our planet’s poles. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can cause species to move out of habitats that become uncomfortable and into areas that couldn’t support them before. It can also mean that changes linked to seasons (known as ‘phenology’) such as leaf fall, bud burst and flowering start to take place at different times. This may cause problems for other species that are hard to predict. Seek out your local plant life and see how your local environment may be changing.",

Conforme o Seek for capaz de identificar com confiança a espécie que está a focar em cada nível, irá adicionar outro ponto à barra. Quando o organismo for identificada com a espécie, tire uma foto!",
    "header_2": "Dicas e Truques",
    "tips": "Seek is best at identifying photos with good lighting and a clear shot of the species, so try different angles until you get the right shot.\n\nSeek is still learning, so if the dots can’t seem to fill up all the way, you’re probably looking at an organism that’s not commonly found in iNaturalist’s database. You can post observations to iNaturalist to help Seek learn to identify these better!",

If possible, we encourage you to pick a place such as a local park, protected area, or your yard that you visit every month as part of your explorations with Seek. For this month's mission: find any ten species that make you feel happy!\n\nTo find resources to help you use Seek and learn more about biodiversity, visit NatGeoEd.org/BioBlitz.",

For example, we can help take care of a particular place like our own yard, a protected area, or a local park. Protecting nature starts by learning about the plants, fungi and animals that are in the places that you care about. Your challenge this month is to look in your yard or a local park and take an inventory of as much biodiversity as you can.",
    "june_2021_action": "This month, focus on learning something about each species you document, including which ones are native and which are introduced.  Reflect on all of your observations over the past four months— what differences have you noticed in biodiversity and the human footprint across this period and across the different places you've explored? Identify something you can commit to doing to help make a local place (such as your yard or a park) healthier for native species. Write down your goal, take a photo of it, and share it with us at #NatGeoSeekChallenge on Twitter!",
